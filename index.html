				<h4> Get Started.</h4>
				<h5 class="bolder">Go <a href="http://www.veteransintech.org/software-engineer-microsoft" target="_blank">here</a> to view my Mentor's blog.  He has many tips to help you become that interesting interviewee with a love for tech that the big companies are looking for.  His help has been invaluable to me on my personal journey.  Check him out, you won't regret it.</h5>
				<h4>From the Soapbox</h4>
				<ul>
					<p>I was told by the "experts" that I needed to apply for other "non-coding" positions in tech; they said, "There's no way you can compete with the CS grads coming out of college".  I was told that I was a potential 'fit', but <em>not</em> for development.  I heard all of that garbage and noise, and I thought, "<strong>So what! I'm still going to be a developer.</strong>" So, <em>Here I am</em>, 8 months later, about to start my second programming gig with a great company after being successful on the job at my first gig. <em>Don't</em> take no for an answer. <em>Work</em> hard. <em>Believe</em> in yourself. You <em>can</em> do it. Getting off of my soapbox, now.</p>
				</ul>
				<h4>Code. Read. Network. Eat. Poop. Sleep. (in that order) </h4>
				<ul>
					
					<h5>Consume Podcasts and Audiobooks on your daily commute.</h5><p>The two buddies that I learned this practice from (albeit, late in the game), currently work for Microsoft, making big boy change.</p>
					<h5>Read as much as you can when away from the screen.</h5><p><a href="http://www.codingdojo.com/blog/9-best-programming-books-read-right-now-want-distinguish/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a short list, by no means comprehensive.  See what your buddies are reading.  Take recommendations.  Just keep expanding your mind and constantly pulling in new information. I recently read "Mindset" by Carol Dweck.  Take her advice and embrace a "growth mindset".</p>
					<h5>Make friends with programmers.</h5><p>Learn the insider lingo.  Do as many informational interviews as you can handle off of LinkedIn.  Just inbox them and display an earnest desire to learn.  Works a lot more than you think.</p>
					<h5>Challenge Yourself Daily.</h5><p>Document the memorable challenges you face, and be prepared to talk about them in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_Task,_Action,_Result">STAR format</a>. Keep a journal of your challenges, and have a whole bunch of them ready to whip out on your next phone screen or interview</p>
					<h5>White Board.</h5><p>Get one.  Hang it on your wall. Start solving some algorithm-related problems armed with only your logic as a tool.  Pseudo-code your way to a solution.  Research the code you will need.  Solve the problem. Rinse. Lather. Repeat.  As you grow, you will drop the research step, and with every problem solved, you become a better programmer.  Talk while you code on the white board to your imaginary audience.  Explain WHY you are doing this step or that one.  Do it with a friend trying to sharpshoot you.  This is, by far, the most helpful practice to get better. I still do it every day. Even at work, with production problems. </p>

			<h2><a><i class="fa fa-question" aria-hidden="true"></i> About Me</a></h2>
			<h5>My Roots</h5>
			<p>
			I am a former Army Paratrooper with twenty years of service to our great country.  I served most of my time at Fort Bragg, NC in the 82nd Airborne Division.  I retired as a Sergeant First Class, and treasure all of the people that have helped me along the way during my career.  When transitioning out of the military, I happened upon a transition program that changed my life.  I participated in the first Microsoft Software and Systems Academy Cohort on Fort Bragg.  I met many influential people, learned to believe in my ability to thrive in tech, and had a lot of fun in my journey to become the person I am today during the course.  I owe much of my success to this program, and highly recommend it to any transitioning service member or veteran.  I am a family man, with three sons aged 17, 7, and 2.  I also have a daughter from another daddy, aged 13, that am just as proud of.  I enjoy spending time with family, having a cocktail or two, and enjoying the outdoors, especially the beach.
			</p>
			<h5>My Present</h5>
			<p>
			I am a Junior Software Developer with three months of total experience working with production code.  I owe my last employer, The Oryza Group, a huge debt of gratitude for having faith in a programmer with zero experience.  I really enjoyed working there, and would recommend the environment to anyone looking to break into a developer role.  I have recently accepted an offer with Booz Allen Hamilton as a Software Developer II in Atlanta, GA.  I am currently in the process of moving, and am very excited about joining a new team in a new city!    
			</p>
			<h5>My Future</h5>
			<p>
			I think the future is what you make it with your actions today.  I plan to grind as hard as I can, absorb all of the information I can consume, and just fulfill the goal of becoming a better developer, one day at a time, one step at a time, with the goal of becoming someone who excels in his craft.  I see myself staying in the Peach State for a long time, and exploring the possibilities that becoming a world-class Dev may bring.  My dream is to collaborate on something noble and useful that ordinary people can use to improve their lives on a daily basis, someday.  Good luck to you on your journey, and check back with me if you want an update on mine!  Take care and Godspeed to you!
