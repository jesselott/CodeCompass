				<h4>From the Soapbox</h4>
				<ul>
					<p>I was told by the "experts" that I needed to apply for other "non-coding" positions in tech; they said, "There's no way you can compete with the CS grads coming out of college".  I was told that I was a potential 'fit', but <em>not</em> for development.  I heard all of that garbage and noise, and I thought, "<strong>So what! I'm still going to be a developer.</strong>" So, <em>Here I am</em>, 8 months later, about to start my second programming gig with a great company after being successful on the job at my first gig. <em>Don't</em> take no for an answer. <em>Work</em> hard. <em>Believe</em> in yourself. You <em>can</em> do it. Getting off of my soapbox, now.</p>
				</ul>
				<h4>Code. Read. Network. Eat. Poop. Sleep. (in that order) </h4>
				<ul>
					<h5>Consume Podcasts and Audiobooks on your daily commute.</h5><p>The two buddies that I learned this practice from (albeit, late in the game), currently work for Microsoft, making big boy change.</p>
					<h5>Read as much as you can when away from the screen.</h5><p><a href="http://www.codingdojo.com/blog/9-best-programming-books-read-right-now-want-distinguish/">Here</a> is a short list, by no means comprehensive.  See what your buddies are reading.  Take recommendations.  Just keep expanding your mind and constantly pulling in new information. I recently read "Mindset" by Carol Dweck.  Take her advice and embrace a "growth mindset".</p>
					<h5>Make friends with programmers.</h5><p>Learn the insider lingo.  Do as many informational interviews as you can handle off of LinkedIn.  Just inbox them and display an earnest desire to learn.  Works a lot more than you think.</p>
					<h5>Challenge Yourself Daily.</h5><p>Document the memorable challenges you face, and be prepared to talk about them in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situation,_Task,_Action,_Result">STAR format</a>. Keep a journal of your challenges, and have a whole bunch of them ready to whip out on your next phone screen or interview</p>
					<h5>White Board.</h5><p>Get one.  Hang it on your wall. Start solving some algorithm-related problems armed with only your logic as a tool.  Pseudo-code your way to a solution.  Research the code you will need.  Solve the problem. Rinse. Lather. Repeat.  As you grow, you will drop the research step, and with every problem solved, you become a better programmer.  Talk while you code on the white board to your imaginary audience.  Explain WHY you are doing this step or that one.  Do it with a friend trying to sharpshoot you.  This is, by far, the most helpful practice to get better. I still do it every day. Even at work, with production problems. </p>
